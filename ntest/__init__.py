ntest â€“ A Lightweight Python toolkit for writing and running unit tests. 
This is an effort to "write my own unit tests" as the cool kids say. I don't hate pyunit I just like making my own.

installation:
    pip install ntest

quickstart:
    - just make a funcy:

    def test() -> None:
        assert 1 + 1 == 2

    - then run ntest

    [output here when i'm not lazy]
